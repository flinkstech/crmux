Chrome developer tools remote protocol multiplexer.

Chrome does not allow more then one developer tools connection to the a tab. **crmux** multiplexes incoming connections into single websocket connection and transparently matches and translates JSON-RPC request and response message IDs from single local range to multiple remote ranges of ID'. Events are dispatched to all clients.

## Install
With [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the npm package manager:

	npm install crmux -g

You can now use `crmux` from the command line.

## Connecting

Start chrome with remote protocol enabled:

```
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

Start `crmux`:

```
$> crmux 
```

Now you can attach more than one devtools client on port 9223 ( browse to `http://localhost:9223/` to see list of inspectable tabs )
